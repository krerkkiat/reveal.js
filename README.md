## The OU EECS Theme

An attempt to replicate the [OU's branded template](https://www.ohio.edu/business/resources/faculty-staff/branded-templates) in reveal.js. So far the logo on the top left and the college or department name on
the bottom left are implemented.

Why reveal.js? So far it seems to be the most mature and still being maintained. With reveal.js you can
also

- Write your content using Markdown or HTML/CSS.
- Have code with syntax highlighting for free.

### Viewing the Slides

```console
npm run start
```

### Features

**Light Background**

In Markdown, add

```markdown
<!-- .slide: data-ou-bg-type="light" -->
```

For HTML, just add that `data-ou-bg-type="light"` to the `<section>` tag.

**Font**

If you want to have same font as the tempalte, follow the instructions at https://www.ohio.edu/ucm/ohio-brand/typography.

### Want to Modify the Theme?

The source file is at `css/theme/source/ou.scss`. You can then re-build the theme with

```console
npm run build -- css-themes
```
